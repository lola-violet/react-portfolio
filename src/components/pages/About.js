                    <p>Full-stack web developer with 3+ years of digital marketing experience, a BBA in Management from Berkeley College New York, and a certificate in full-stack web development from the University of Washington's Professional & Continuing Education program. Aiming to leverage my background in marketing & management with newly developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, third-party APIs, and NodeJS.</p>
                    <p>Using an iterative build approach, I recently collaborated with 3 classmates, creating a trivia application that won the people's choice award (based on votes from all students in our class). As our team's Git Administrator, I used my background in organizational management to oversee our Github workflow, managing several branches & a virtual kanban board. I look forward to applying my new development skills in a collaborative professional environment with a focus on mobile-first & user-centered design.</p>
